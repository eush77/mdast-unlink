[**remark**][remark] plugin to remove all links, images, references, and
definitions.

Original motivation was to process Markdown documents in a way that would make
it easier to read as a plain text.
On an ebook reader or a piece of paper the links are useless and look ugly.

## Note!

This plugin is ready for the new parser in remark
([`remarkjs/remark#536`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark/pull/536)).
No change is needed: it works exactly the same now as it did before!

## Install

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c):
Node 12+ is needed to use it and it must be `import`ed instead of `require`d.

[npm][]:

```sh
npm install remark-unlink
```

## Use

Say we have the following file, `example.md`.
Imagine section titles and URLs a bit longer though.

```markdown
## TOC

- [section 1](#section-1)
- [section 2](#section-2)

## section 1

Section [content][1] may include some [links](https://domain.name/path).

[1]: https://domain.name/path

## section 2

![some images are here also](https://gif.com/1.gif)

More content.
```

And our module, `example.js`, looks as follows:

```js
import {readSync} from 'to-vfile'
import {remark} from 'remark'
import remarkUnlink from 'remark-unlink'

const file = readSync('example.md')

remark()
  .use(remarkUnlink)
  .process(file)
  .then((file) => {
    console.log(String(file))
  })
```

Now, running `node example` yields:

```markdown
## TOC

-   section 1
-   section 2

## section 1

Section content may include some links.

## section 2

More content.
```

## API

This package exports no identifiers.
The default export is `remarkUnlink`.

#### `unified().use(remarkUnlink)`

Plugin to remove all links, images, references, and definitions.

## Security

Use of `remark-unlink` does not involve [**rehype**][rehype] ([**hast**][hast])
or user content so there are no openings for [cross-site scripting (XSS)][xss]
attacks.
